## Spectral clustering algorithm based web mining and quadratic support vector machine for learning style prediction in E-learning platform
The collection of data is from the Kaggle website which involves log files and web log files. Pre-processing step performs
data encoding and further web mining-based feature extraction is performed
then the extracted features are clustered via the spectral clustering
model. Finally, various learning styles are predicted using the
Quadratic SVM model. Python platform executes the implementation with an accuracy of 95.45%.
